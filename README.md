# GEEKNIK LABS

**What is Geeknik Labs?**

Geeknik Labs (& Farm) is a small security research lab located upon the rural farmland of central Oklahoma. Brian Carpenter is a retired police officer and former OpenDNS systems administrator with a knack for finding security flaws in open source software. My wife, April Carpenter, handles day to day operations for a non-profit org in Oklahoma City whilst battling fibromyalgia and a rare brain disorder. During the past few years, Geeknik Labs has found and helped fixed thousands of bugs in hundreds of open source projects, as well as over 100 CVE assignments and security advisories.

In 2019 our chili pepper farm was started and we grew 2 different varieties of peppers: Habanero and a "Big Thai" hybrid. They were both bountiful and delicious. In 2020 we hope to expand to a dozen different varieties. We're even working towards buying a large commercial building. Stay tuned!

**Do I have to donate to you? What makes you so special? Why should I donate to you?**

No. Absolutely not. But if you love me, or, you love seeing the unintended behavior I cause in software and you want to make sure that I'm justly compensated for my time and effort towards making the Internet a safer place, then by all means, shovel cash into our accounts. But seriously, I don't expect you to donate to us.
